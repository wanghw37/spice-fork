# SPICE: Selection Patterns In somatic Copy-number Events

![](doc/logo_banner.png)

**SPICE**, Selection Patterns In somatic Copy-number Events, is an event-level framework that infers discrete copy-number events from allele-specific profiles.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.8
- medicc2 (including openfst)

### Install from pip/conda (recommended)
Coming soon!

### Install from source

1. Install MEDICC2 using conda/mamba:
```bash
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge medicc2
```

Or better directly create a new conda environment with MEDICC2 inside of it 
```bash
conda create -n spice_env -c conda-forge -c bioconda medicc2
conda activate spice_env
```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:schwarzlab/spice.git
cd spice
```

3. Install in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will install SPICE and all its dependencies, and make the `spice` command available in your shell.

### Dependencies

SPICE automatically installs the following dependencies:
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- pyyaml
- joblib
- ortools (version 9.8.3296)

### Optional Dependencies

To use SPICE with Snakemake for parallel execution on computing clusters, install snakemake separately:
```bash
pip install 'snakemake>=7.0'
```


## Configuration

SPICE uses a configuration file for each run which are specified using the `--config` flag.
This means you can keep multiple configs (e.g., in `configs/`) and select them at runtime.

Parameters and directories not specified in the provided config file are taken from the default config file `default_config.yaml`.

### Minimal `config.yaml` override example
Each config must contain a name and the location of the input copy-number file like so:
```yaml
name: example_run
input_files:
   copynumber: data/example_data.tsv
```

For other parameters that can be modified, see `default_config.yaml`.

### Relative vs absolute paths

- `directories.*` entries (e.g., `data_dir`, `results_dir`, `log_dir`) as well as input files can be given as relative or absolute paths.
   - If relative, SPICE resolves them against the package root (i.e., the repository directory when installed in editable mode).
   - If absolute, SPICE uses them as-is.

### WGD Detection

SPICE supports two ways to determine WGD (whole genome duplication) status per sample. The pipeline branches on WGD status and uses different FSTs and neutral CN values accordingly.

- Provided status via `wgd_status` file:
   - Set `input_files.wgd_status` in your config to a TSV file.
   - The file must have two columns: first column is the sample identifier (used as index), second column named `wgd` with boolean values (`True`/`False`).
   - Example:
      ```tsv
      sample_id	wgd
      SA123	True
      SA456	False
      ```


- Inferred WGD status:
   - If `input_files.wgd_status` is missing or empty, SPICE infers WGD using copy-number data and the method specified by `params.wgd_inference_method`.
   - Supported values:
      - `major_cn`: heuristic whether at least half of the major copy-number is greater or equal to 2
      - `ploidy_loh`: PCAWG-style rule combining ploidy and LOH fraction

Notes
- WGD status impacts neutral CN values and constraint solving throughout the pipeline, so ensure this is set or inferred correctly.
- For haplotype-specific data, neutral CN is 1 (noWGD) vs 2 (WGD); for total CN, 2 vs 4 respectively.

### Sex (XY/XX) Detection

SPICE supports resolving sample sex (XY vs XX) either via a provided file or automatic inference. This affects handling of `chrX` and `chrY` in preprocessing and splitting.

- Provided status via `xy_samples` file:
   - Set `input_files.xy_samples` in your config to a TSV file.
   - The file must have two columns: first column is the sample identifier (used as index), second column named `xy` with boolean values (`True`/`False`) indicating XY (male) vs XX (female).
   - Example:
      ```tsv
      sample_id	xy
      SA123	True
      SA456	False
      ```

- Inferred XY status:
   - If `input_files.xy_samples` is missing or empty, SPICE infers XY by checking if any segments exist on chromosome `chrY` for a sample.

Effects
- For XY samples with haplotype-specific CN, the minor copy number of `chrX` and `chrY` is set to 0 during preprocessing and splitting.
- For XX samples, `chrY` is excluded (no segments on `chrY`).


## Usage

SPICE has three main modes:
- **event_inference**: Infer discrete copy-number events from profiles
- **loci_detection**: Detect recurrent copy-number loci across samples
- **plotting**: Generate visualizations of inferred events and detected loci


Example usage

```bash
spice event_inference --config configs/example_config.yaml
```

**For large datasets we recommend using the Snakemake mode on a computing cluster (see below)**.

**Note that spice automatically deletes previous runs of the same name when it is rerun.**

### Event Inference

The event inference pipeline runs 5 steps:
- `preprocessing`: Extra preprocessing (filling telomeres, phasing, etc.)
- `split`: Split haplotypes and preprocess input
- `all_solutions`: Enumerate all valid evolutionary paths
- `disambiguate`: Select best path using k-nearest neighbors
- `large_chroms`: Use MCMC sampling for chromosomes with many events
- `combine`: Combine all events into the final output

For each step, nonWGD and WGD samples are treated separately and samples are split by chromosome and allele to give the file IDs "sample:chrom:allele". For each step, each ID is calculated separately and stored as separate files.

Intermediate files can be removed using
```bash
spice event_inference --clean --config <path/to/config>
```


#### Preprocessing Step Details

The preprocessing step runs automatically (unless `--skip-preprocessing` is provided) and prepares the input for robust event inference. It performs:

- Data normalization: ensures chromosome names use `chr` prefix; converts starts/ends to integers and adjusts starts to 0-based.
- CN capping and filtering: caps copy numbers at 8; removes segments shorter than 1kb.
- WGD resolution: loads from `wgd_status.tsv` or infers as described in WGD Detection.
- Sex resolution: loads from `xy_samples.tsv` or infers by presence of `chrY`; for XY samples with haplotype-specific CN, sets minor CN of `chrX` and `chrY` to 0.
- Neighbor merging: merges adjacent segments with identical CNs to reduce fragmentation.
- Telomeres and centromeres: fills telomeric regions and optionally bins/unifies centromeres (can be skipped with `--pre-skip-centromeres`).
- MEDICC2 phasing: optional phasing of haplotypes; can be skipped with `--pre-skip-phasing`.
- Short arms and bounds: handles short arms and aligns segment ends to reference chromosome lengths.

Run control:
- Use `--skip-preprocessing` to bypass this step and proceed directly to `split`.




#### Parallel processing

Use multiple cores for event inference:
```bash
# Use 8 cores
spice event_inference --config <path/to/config> --cores 8
```
While using multiple cores can technically make execution faster (especially in the case when spice takes a long time for single runs), it can also slow down execution when there are many entries to loop over.
We usually recommend to only use multiple cores for the `large_chroms` pipeline step as it takes the longest per sample.

Note that parallel processing will disable logging for the different subprocesses.

### Logging output

Control where logging output is sent with the `--log` flag:

* `--log terminal` (default): Writes logs to terminal only
* `--log file`: Writes logs to file only
* `--log both`: Writes logs to both terminal and file

When using `--log file` or `--log both`, logs are saved to the configured log directory from the config with a filename pattern: `{name}_{timestamp}.log`

### Dection of loci of selection

Coming soon!


### Plotting

Plotting inferred events can be done on the sample or ID (sample, chromosome, allele) level.

```bash
# Plot inferred events per sample
spice plotting --config <path/to/config> --plot-sample <SAMPLE_ID>
spice plotting --config <path/to/config> --plot-sample <SAMPLE_ID> --plot-unit-size

# Plot per ID (format: sample:chr:cn_a|cn_b)
spice plotting --config <path/to/config> --plot-id <sample:chr:allele>
```

Notes for plotting:
- Plotting requires `final_events.tsv` (produced by the `combine` step in event_inference).
- Output PNGs are saved to `plot_dir/{name}/` (see `directories.plot_dir` in config; defaults to `plots/`).
- `--plot-unit-size` switches per-sample plots to unit-size segments.
- You must specify either `--plot-sample` or `--plot-id` (not both).

For interactive exploration, see `notebooks/plotting.ipynb`.



## Input Format

SPICE expects tab-separated input files with copy-number segments. See example file `data/example_data.tsv`.

Required columns:
- `sample`: Sample identifier
- `chrom`: Chromosome name
- `start`: Segment start position
- `end`: Segment end position
- `cn_a`: Copy number for allele A (haplotype-specific)
- `cn_b`: Copy number for allele B (haplotype-specific only)

Total copy-number mode can be enabled by setting `params.total_cn: True` in the config file.

## Output

Results are saved in `results/{name}/`

The two main outputs are `summary.tsv` which is a summary over each ID (i.e. combination of sample, chromosome and allele) and the `final_events_df.tsv` which is a list of all inferred events.

### Intermediate files

The intermediate files are saved with separate directories for WGD and non-WGD profiles:
- `chrom_data_full/`: Preprocessed chromosome data
- `full_paths_single_solution/`: Chromosomes with unique solutions
- `full_paths_multiple_solutions/`: Chromosomes requiring kNN selection
- `knn_solved_chroms/`: Results from kNN selection
- `mcmc_solved_chroms_large/`: Results from MCMC sampling

Intermediate files can be removed using

```bash
spice event_inference --clean --config <path/to/config>
```

## Advanced Usage

### Run specific pipeline steps

The SPICE event reconstruction has 5 sub-steps:
- `split`: Split haplotypes and preprocess input
- `all_solutions`: Enumerate all valid evolutionary paths
- `disambiguate`: Select best path using k-nearest neighbors
- `large_chroms`: Use MCMC sampling for chromosomes with many events
- `combine`: Combine all events into the final output
```

To run specific steps, use the `--steps` flag:

```bash
# Run only input splitting
spice split --config <path/to/config>

# Run path enumeration and kNN selection
spice all_solutions disambiguate --config <path/to/config>

# Run MCMC sampling for large chromosomes
spice large_chroms --config <path/to/config>

# Run from a step onward (using + syntax)
spice --config <path/to/config> --steps split+
```


### Using with Snakemake

The SPICE Snakemake workflow mirrors the full event inference pipeline.

**Note:** Snakemake must be installed separately:
```bash
pip install 'snakemake>=7.0'
```

```bash
# Local execution
spice --config <path/to/config> --snakemake --snakemake-mode local --snakemake-cores 1

# Slurm execution
spice --config <path/to/config> --snakemake --snakemake-mode slurm --snakemake-jobs 250
```

### Python API

You can also import and use SPICE functions directly in Python. Note that it is important to run `spice.load_config(config_file)` before any other spice imports
```python
import spice
spice.load_config(config_file)
from spice.pipeline import full_paths_from_graph_with_sv_wrapper
from spice.knn_graph import solve_with_knn
from spice.mcmc_for_large_chroms import mcmc_event_selection
```
